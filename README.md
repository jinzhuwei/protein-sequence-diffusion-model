## Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model For Protein Sequence Generation

Implementation of a proof of concept (POC) that leverages <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</a> to generate protein sequences. Code is implemented in pytorch.


This implementation of DDPM was transcribed from lucidrains <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch">here</a>
I replace the UNet with a pre-trained protein language model ESM-2 for the denoising part.

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pengzhangzhi/denoising-diffusion-protein-sequence
```
```bash
cd denoising_diffusion_protein_sequence
```
Install this package
```bash
pip install .
```
Install esm to get the language model. The esm is hacked for this project. The original esm see [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm).
```bash
cd esm
```

```bash
pip install .
```

## Sampling Protein Sequences

```bash
cd denoising_diffusion_pytorch
```
Use pretrained model in `denoising_diffusion_pytorch/experiment/best-v1.ckpt`  to sample novel protein sequences.

```
python sample.py
```
Results will be saved in `denoising_diffusion_pytorch/generated_protein_seqs.fasta`.


## Training

I use pytorch-lighning to train the denosing diffusion model. Command line arguments can be passed to manipulate the training, details see `denoising_diffusion_pytorch/add_args.py`.
```bash
cd denoising_diffusion_pytorch
```

```bash
python pl_train.py 
```
